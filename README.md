### QR code generator GUI &amp; CLI (offline) and 100% safe.

will i got this idea when i was browsing the "темная сеть".
nah im kidding, it's just more secure to have your own toolkit..
to manage and complete your work anonymously.

just imagine going to those websites around the internet and..
send them your personal informations to convert it to a QR code.

man it's pretty unsecure and your exposing your own data.
