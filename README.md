# QRer
### QR code generator GUI &amp; CLI (offline) and 100% safe.

---
will i got this idea when i was browsing the "темная сеть".
nah im kidding, it's just more secure to have your own toolkit..
to manage and complete your work anonymously.

just imagine going to those websites around the internet and..
send them your personal informations to convert it to a QR code.

man it's pretty unsecure and you exposing your own data.

# Usage:
  ### if your want to use the GUI just run the executeable in the terminal or by double clicking it.
  ### else if you want to run it in the terminal just do 
  ```python
  python3 QRer.py -c
  ```
  ### or
  ```python
  python3 QRer.py --cli
  ```
  ### for now, cli on terminal only works within the source code itself (:
